# Scratching Your Travel Itch

## Languages, Libraries, and APIs Used
* HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* jQuery
* Metro_4
* Bootstrap
* Flagpedia API
* MediaWiki Api
* NYTimes API
* Spoonify API
* Spotify API

## Application's Purpose
Allows a user to find more information about a given country, so that they can experience that culture in a small way, without having to actually travel. If however the user would like to eventually travel to said country, they will be all the more prepared after using this application.

## Development Process
The collaborators on this project each took on their own role and they are as follows:
* Jani Muhlestein - Spoonify API
* Jeremy Cornwall - MediaWiki & NYTimes APIs
* Laurie Graff - Styling
* Logan Merchant - Spotify API & Flagpedia API
</br>
The individuals working with APIs worked to get the `fetch` calls working while Laurie worked on the styling of the application. The team discussed how their contributions would interact with the others' and made changes as necessary. Once each section of the application was finished, we began to merge each branch into `develop` and found there were some merge conflicts. After some more discussion, we were able to resolve those conflicts and get an MVP published.
