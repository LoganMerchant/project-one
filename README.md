## Application's Purpose

Scratching Your Travel Itch gives a user more information about a given country, so that they can experience a portion of it without having to actually travel.

Interested in what that country's citizens are listening to? Listen to the top Spotify playlists in the country.

Curious about the history and current events of the country? Check out the country's flag, read it's latest New York Times article, and get the link to it's Wikipedia page.

Feeling hungry? Get a recipe inspired by the country to cook at home.

With all this at a user's fingertips, they'll be all the more prepared for when they eventually visit the country.

## Development Process

The individuals working with APIs worked to get the `fetch` calls working while Laurie worked on the styling of the application. The team discussed how their contributions would interact with the others' and made changes as necessary. Once each section of the application was finished, we began to merge each branch into `develop` and found there were some merge conflicts. After some more discussion, we were able to resolve those conflicts and get an MVP published.
