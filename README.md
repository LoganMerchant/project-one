## Development Process

The individuals working with APIs worked to get the `fetch` calls working while Laurie worked on the styling of the application. The team discussed how their contributions would interact with the others' and made changes as necessary. Once each section of the application was finished, we began to merge each branch into `develop` and found there were some merge conflicts. After some more discussion, we were able to resolve those conflicts and get an MVP published.
